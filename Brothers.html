    <h2>Character: </h2>
       <p>Anshu is kind enough to go against the exterminator principles and protect some races. In fact, Anshu was not for the extermination of humanity, but he was not against it either. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether he is for humanity or not. Most likely neutral.</p>

Everything he drew with a special invisible seal will appear. He can even change character or change physics if he simply draws it or writes about it with a stamp.
        </p>
        <h2>Character:</h2>
            <p>Infei is not particularly kind because he created a race of exterminators and gave them orders to destroy weak and unnecessary races on behalf of a non-existent author.</p>
