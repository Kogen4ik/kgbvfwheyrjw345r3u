    <p>1) Kogen's first and real race is titan.</p>
    <p>2) Second race was <i>self-called demon</i></p>
    <p>3) And after becoming exterminator, he's race is exterminator now.</p>
    <h3>First:</h3>
    <p>Titan race is undying race made by <i>Infei</i>.</p>
    <p>In all world only 2 titans, without Infei.</p>
    <h3>Second:</h3>
    <p>Self-called demon can be everyone, but just called demon.
        Like, if human say that he demon, and prove it, then he is self-called demon.</p>
    <h3>Third:</h3>
    <p>Exterminators.
        They most strongest race ever, they have infinite regeneration. They have personal magic and many other abilitys.
    Exterminator can do anything they want, but they need to exterminate weak and useless races if that say <i>Infei</i>. </p>
    <p>The closer exterminator's grade is to one, the stronger he is.</p>
    <p>Itâ€™s difficult to become an exterminator, you have to kill all your relatives if you feel an attachment that interferes.
         You need to kill the "observer" of your race. Reach the peak of your strength and become stronger than your race. And many unknown points
